FILES.
  I can manage files witing python just like any other objects
  
  MODULES:
    Python files with functions and variables in it, and I can import it into some other files or in the shell.
    I can do that with the keyword import. Example:
      import <madule>
      from <module> import *
  FILES:
    nameForHandle = open ('kids', 'w')
    nameHandle.close()
