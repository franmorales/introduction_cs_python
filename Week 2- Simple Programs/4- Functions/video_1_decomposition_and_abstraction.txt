Decomposition  and abstraction - FUNCTIONS.

Los pilares basicos un buen diseno se basan practcamente en esto... DECOMPOSITION AND ABSTRACTION.

MEASURE GOOD PROGRAMMERS BY THE AMOUNT OF FUNCTIONALITY!!! 

Function: 
  Decomposition:
    Modularity. Devide one task in many litle tasks to accomplish a bigger task
  
  Abstraction:
    Black-box concept. I don't need how it acutally works, I only need to know which are the inputs and what should I expect
    for outputs. SUPRESE THE DETAILS.
   
   
KEY IDEAS:
  Break the code into pieces.
  Suprese the details.
