Once you know you have a bug:
  ISOLATE  THE BUG
  ERADICATE THE BUG
  RETEST UNTIL CODE RUNS CORRECTLY

Runtimes Bugs:
  overt: obvious manifestation
  Covert: Has no obvious manifestation - code returns incorrect values 
  
  persistent: occurs every time code is run
  Intermittent: Only occurs some times, even if run on same input

Overt and persistent:
  Obvious to detecct
  Use defensive programming to try to ensure that if error is made, bug will fall into this category

Overt and intermittent
  More frustrating, can be harder to debug, but if conditions that prompt bug can be reproduced, can be handled
  
Covert
  Highly dangerous, as users may not realize answers are incorrect until code has been run for long period.,
