    Want to be sure that assumptions on state of computation are as expected.
    Use an assert statement to raise an AssertionError exception if assumptions not
    met
    A technique for good defensive programming.

Where to use assertions?
- Goal is to spot a bug as soon as introduced.
- Use as a supplement to testing
- Raise exceptions if users supplies bad data input.
- To check:
  Types of arguments
  Invariants on data structres are met
  Constraints
  Violations of constraints on procedure.
