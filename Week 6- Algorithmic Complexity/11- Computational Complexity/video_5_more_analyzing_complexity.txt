Exponential Complexity

Recursive functions WHERE MORE THAN ONE RECURSIVE CALL FOR EACH SIZE OF PROBLEM (Problemas recursivos que se llaman mas de una
vez a si mismas en cada recursion)
  Towers of Hanoi

Many important problems are inherently exponential
  Unfortunate,  as cost can be high
  will lead us to consider approximate solutions more quickly
