Question:

As discussed in lecture is correct syntactic. Doesn't - - 4 represents ? Then this should result in error.

Answer:

That's because (-) has two uses, as a binary operator and as a unary operator.

The binary means substract ie:

2 - 3
The unary means negate, returns the negative of a number. So read it as:

-(-4)
And remembering elementary maths classes, what is the negative of a negative number? Positive!
